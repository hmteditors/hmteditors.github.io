All contributors should also be members of the [HMT editors resource forum](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=groups2&passive=1209600&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fgroups.google.com%2Fforum%2F&followup=https%3A%2F%2Fgroups.google.com%2Fforum%2F&authuser=0#!forum/homer-multitext-editors-resource-forum).

We're collecting all of our documentation, including the guide for editors, in the [HMT project documentation](http://homermultitext.github.io/hmt-docs/).
